# Authentication

API authentication is done via access tokens, access tokens can be issued in a couple ways:

* By authenticating via username and password \(only allowed for the website\)
* User or organization issued access tokens

Getting tokens via OAuth2 will be another authentication method offered in the future.

Authentication is only required for modifying and creating snippets and accounts.
